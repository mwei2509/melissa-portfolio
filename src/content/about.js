  bio: `I am a full stack web developer living in NYC and I love building cool, visually stimulating
    web apps. I'm obsessed with manipulating the browser and animating elements through code.\n\n
    I moved from Texas to NYC to study Neuroscience
    at Columbia University, and while my path has diverged from research, I
    one day hope to integrate the more fascinating aspects of the human
    mind with programming.  When I'm not experimenting with code and learning new things, I'm
    either rock climbing, running, or playing RPGs.`
